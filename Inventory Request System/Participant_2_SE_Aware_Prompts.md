# Participant 2: Inventory Request System Prompts

## Instructions

Copy and paste the prompts in order.

Do not expand them into long prompt-engineering instructions.

Use one stage at a time. If the AI implements future-stage features early, use the reusable failure prompt.

If the result is incomplete, use the reusable failure prompt.

If the app gives an error, use the error prompt and paste the error message.

Do not create instruction `.md` files in the project codebase.

## Copy-Paste Prompts

### Stage 0: Case Scope

```text
Summarize Inventory Request System: roles staff member and storekeeper, main entity inventory request, main feature inventory request submission, approval/rejection and issue workflow, secondary feature filter requests by item name, requester or status, and out of scope. Do not create project files yet.
```

### Stage 1: Requirements

```text
List requirements for Inventory Request System: main workflow inventory request submission, approval/rejection and issue workflow, create/view/update/status actions where appropriate, roles, validation, login, protected action approve or reject requests, mark items issued, and edit storekeeper notes, and basic automated tests. Do not create application code yet.
```

### Stage 2: PERN Structure

```text
Create PERN project structure: React frontend, Express backend, Supabase PostgreSQL, env setup, routes, pages, and run steps. Scaffold only. Do not implement the full business workflow yet.
```

### Stage 3: Data Model

```text
Design Supabase table for inventory request using itemName, quantity, reason, requestedDate, requesterName, status, storekeeperNote, issuedQuantity, issuedAt, createdAt, updatedAt, initial status values pending, approved, rejected, issued, required fields, and role fields.

Use this Supabase PostgreSQL database information:
DATABASE_URL: [SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL]
Database password: [SUPABASE_DATABASE_PASSWORD]

Requirements:
- Use the Express backend with pg and DATABASE_URL for database access.
- Do not use Supabase URL/key style configuration for database queries.
- Put secrets only in backend .env; never expose them in React.
- Create a repeatable database setup script, for example npm run db:setup.
- Create safe seed data for the workshop.
- Create a login/users table for the two roles.
- Do not rely on hard-coded frontend-only accounts.
- Use clearly labelled test records in the same Supabase database and clean them up after tests.
- Do not drop existing tables unless the command is clearly named as a demo reset command.
- Do not implement UI features in this stage.
```

### Stage 4: UI Workflow

```text
Create UI workflow for staff member and storekeeper: pages, forms, list, filters, role actions, loading, and errors.
```

### Stage 5: Main Feature

```text
Implement inventory request submission, approval/rejection and issue workflow for inventory request with React pages, Express routes, Supabase queries, validation, and errors.
```

### Stage 6: Authentication And Authorization

```text
Add database-backed login and authorization for staff member and storekeeper. Use the users/login table from Stage 3. Use a simple login-issued user identity or session token for later requests. Protected backend routes must look up/check the user's role and ownership from the database before allowing actions. Do not trust a role, user type, or owner name sent directly from the browser as proof of permission. Protect approve or reject requests, mark items issued, and edit storekeeper notes in backend and UI. Do not use hard-coded frontend-only accounts.
```

### Stage 7: Secondary Feature

```text
Add filter requests by item name, requester or status for inventory request. Update API, UI, and filters without adding unrelated features.
```

### Mid Review Stage

Use this after Stage 7 and before Stage 8. This is the same review prompt used by all three participant types for fair comparison.

```text
Conduct a mid-project review for Inventory Request System.

This is review only.
Do not modify application source code.
Do not modify database schema or seed data.
Do not install packages.
Do not create tests.
Do not fix issues.
Only create or update MID_REVIEW.md.

Case details:
- Roles: Staff member, Storekeeper
- Main entity: Inventory Request
- Main workflow: inventory request submission, approval/rejection and issue workflow
- Secondary feature: filter requests by item name, requester or status
- Protected action: approve or reject requests, mark items issued, and edit storekeeper notes

Review the project as it currently exists after the secondary feature stage and before testing, security hardening, and maintainability cleanup.

Check:
- Whether the app appears runnable.
- Whether React frontend and Express backend are separated.
- Whether React calls Express routes instead of Supabase directly.
- Whether Supabase uses DATABASE_URL in the backend without exposing secrets in React.
- Whether the needed database tables appear to exist, including whether a users/login table exists.
- Whether there is a repeatable database setup or seed command.
- Whether login is database-backed, mock-only, role-selector-only, or missing.
- Whether role restrictions are enforced in the backend, not only the UI.
- Whether approve or reject requests, mark items issued, and edit storekeeper notes appears protected.
- Whether users appear limited to their own allowed records where relevant.
- Whether inventory request submission, approval/rejection and issue workflow appears implemented.
- Whether filter requests by item name, requester or status appears implemented.
- Whether validation is present.
- Whether the AI implemented future stages early.
- What is missing before testing, security hardening, and maintainability cleanup.

Use the same review process and scoring matrix that will be used in the final review, so the before/after comparison is fair.

Create a review scoring matrix in MID_REVIEW.md before the issue list. Score each row from 0 to 5.

Score meaning:
- 0 = missing
- 1 = present but mostly not working
- 2 = partially working with major gaps
- 3 = mostly working with important gaps
- 4 = working with minor gaps
- 5 = complete for workshop scope

For the Mid Review, score the current raw project before testing, security hardening, maintainability cleanup, and the change request. For the Testing Evidence column, score test readiness and any test hooks that already exist. Do not create tests.

Use this exact matrix structure:

| Feature / Area | Functionality 0-5 | Data Persistence 0-5 | Backend Security / Role Control 0-5 | Validation / Error Handling 0-5 | Testing Evidence 0-5 | Maintainability 0-5 | UI / Manual Usability 0-5 | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| Project setup and run commands |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Database setup and starter data |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Login workflow |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Role-based access |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Main create action |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Main view/list action |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Main update/status/cancel action |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Protected action |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Secondary feature |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| UI/manual usability |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Security posture |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Testing evidence |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Maintainability |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Save the review in MID_REVIEW.md with:
1. Mid-review summary
2. Review scoring matrix
3. Current feature status
4. Database and persistence status
5. Login and role/access status
6. Protected action status
7. Validation status
8. Stage drift or early implementation
9. Issues found before Stage 8
10. Manual checks recommended next
11. Pass/fail table
```

### Stage 8: Testing

```text
Create automated backend tests and a test command for the main workflow, validation, login, roles, approve or reject requests, mark items issued, and edit storekeeper notes, and filter requests by item name, requester or status.
Use clearly labelled test records in the same Supabase database and clean them up after tests.
Add manual checks only as a supplement. Include a check that direct role/owner spoofing from browser headers, request body, or query parameters is rejected.
```

### Stage 9: Security And Validation

```text
Review security and validation. Fix required fields, backend role access, login-to-authorization gaps, raw role/owner headers, users accessing records outside their role, exposed secrets, fake/in-memory storage, and bad error handling.
```

### Stage 10: Maintainability

```text
Refactor for maintainability: clear names, smaller files, reusable helpers, no behaviour changes, and setup notes.
```

### Stage 11: Change Request

Use this only when the facilitator reaches Stage 11.

```text
Apply change request: approved requests require an issued quantity before they can be marked issued, and issued quantity cannot exceed requested quantity. Update data, database setup scripts, API, UI, validation, roles, and automated tests without rewriting the app.
```

### Stage 12: Final Review

```text

## Reusable Failure Prompt

Use this at any stage when the AI output is incomplete, incorrect, too broad, or not aligned with the selected case.

```text
Revise for Inventory Request System. Keep PERN, small scope, staff member, storekeeper, inventory request, validation, backend role access, database-backed login, approve or reject requests, mark items issued, and edit storekeeper notes, filter requests by item name, requester or status, automated checks, and fix the issue. Do only the current stage.
```
## Error Prompt

Use this when the app fails.

```text
Fix this PERN app error. Keep React, Express, and Supabase. Explain the cause briefly and show the changed files:
